          British	
          Died in London
          Homeschooling
          she was privately educated in mathematics and science
          Mathematician (many awards, medals and a programming 
          language are named after her) The first computer 
          programmer – She developed a computer programming
          system (algorithm) without computers being invented
          yet most known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed 
          mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine.

          19th Century, Pioneer, Mathematician 
            
        <br><br>
        Already at a young age, Ada was very curious, 
        talented and interested in science. At the age of 12 
        she studied birds over years and wanted to 
        invent a flying machine.
        <br><br>
        Due to the fact that women in the 19th century 
        did not have the same rights as men and were not
        allowed to enter universities or academic libraries, 
        her husband William King helped her by copying 
        articles in the library."
