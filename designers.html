      Ada Lovelace
        <div class="content">
          <p class="detext"> 
Ada Lovelace lived in the 19th century and was 
quite ahead of her time: She developed a computer 
programming system without computers being invented yet. 
Back then, even in wealthy families like Ada’s, 
it was not common for women to get the same education 
as men – so Ada was very lucky that her mother provided her 
the best homeschooling teachers. Especially Charles Babbage
had a huge influence on her: He had been working on a 
mechanical calculating machine and since Ada understood 
his quite complex thoughts, they started working together. 
Ada was only 36 when she died of cancer in 1852. In the 
1970s, a computer language (which is still used today) was 
named after her: It’s called ADA.
          </p> 

          <p class="detext"> 
1: Already at a young age, Ada was very curious, 
talented and interested in science. At the age of 12 
she studied birds over years and wanted to 
invent a flying machine.

2: Due to the fact that women in the 19th century 
did not have the same rights as men and were not
allowed to enter universities or academic libraries, 
her husband William King helped her by copying 
articles in the library."
